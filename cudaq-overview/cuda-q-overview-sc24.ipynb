    "Circuit cutting is a common pattern for parallelization. One way of visualizing circuit cutting is through the max cut problem. In this example, we aim to approximate the max cut of a graph with the divide-and-conquer also referred to as QAOA-in-QAOA or QAOA^2 approach which breaks the graph down into smaller subgraphs and solves the max cuts for these subgraphs in parallel using QAOA (see for instance [arXiv:2205.11762v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11762), [arxiv.2101.07813v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07813), [arxiv:2304.03037v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03037), [arxiv:2009.06726](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06726), and [arxiv:2406:17383](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17383)).  By doing this we have effectively cut the QAOA circuit for the larger graph into the smaller QAOA for circuits for the subgraphs.  To complete the circuit cutting, we'll need to merge the results of QAOA on the subgraphs into a result for the entire graph.  This requires solving another smaller optimization problem, which can also be tackled with QAOA.  You can read it about that in more detail in a series of [interactive labs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/tree/main/qaoa-for-max-cut).\n",
